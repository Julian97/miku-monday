## Managing Your Subscription

### Unsubscribing a Channel

If you want to remove the bot from a channel:
1. Send `/unsubscribe` command in the channel
2. The bot will confirm removal and stop sending messages to that channel
3. To resubscribe later, simply send `/start@itsmikumondaybot` again

> **Note:** You can only unsubscribe channels, not private chats. To remove the bot from a channel completely, you'll need to remove it as an administrator in your channel settings.

## Privacy Protection

The `/listchannels` command is restricted to the bot developer only and returns masked, unidentifiable channel data even to the developer. This ensures privacy protection for channels using the bot and prevents exposure of sensitive channel information. Channel IDs are masked to show only the last 4 digits with the rest replaced by asterisks (e.g., ********1234).

## Persistent Storage

The bot supports persistent storage of subscribed channels across deployments:

1. **Redis Storage** (recommended): If a `REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable is provided, chat IDs are stored in Redis with encryption
2. **File Storage** (fallback): If Redis is not available, chat IDs are stored in an encrypted `chat_ids.json` file

For Redis instances that require authentication, set the `REDIS_PASSWORD` environment variable.

With Redis configured, the bot will automatically use Redis for persistent storage, eliminating the need for local file storage. The file-based approach is maintained only as a fallback for environments where Redis is not available.

This ensures that your channel subscriptions are maintained even when the bot is restarted or redeployed.

## Troubleshooting

### If the bot isn't sending GIFs:

1. Check that the bot has the necessary permissions in your channel
2. Make sure the bot hasn't been restricted or banned
3. Verify that the channel is active and not deleted

### If you can't add the bot to your channel:

1. Ensure you have admin rights in the channel
2. Check that the bot is not set to private mode by the owner
3. Make sure you're using the correct bot username

## Privacy and Data

The bot only stores:
- Chat IDs of channels it's added to (needed to send GIFs)
- No personal messages or data are stored
- All data is automatically deleted if the bot is removed from a channel
